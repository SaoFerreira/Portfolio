       Hello!<br>
       This is my first blog. <br>
       Well... i'm not so good with presentations so I'm just gonna say that I love to write and read, 
       and just want to share some of my work and some of my favorite things that i had read.<br>
       As I like to say... <i>"It's all so simple, that sometimes just trying to explain complicates"</i>
       </p>
    
       <p>
    I hope that you enjoy!</p></td>
