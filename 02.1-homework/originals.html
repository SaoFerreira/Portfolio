<h2><u><i>Despair</i></u></h2>
<p>
    The city lights went out. <br>
    It was time for the city to wake up and the sun to caress the land. <br>
    Luisa hadn't slept. She saw the lights go on, the cars go by, a homeless man sleeping 
    and the lights going out. <br>
    She spent the night at the window, waiting for her father to arrive. <br>
    He had promised to come to her birthday, but the day passed, her father didn't say anything 
    and Luisa was already 5 years old and one day. <br>
    It didn't take to long before little Luisa fall asleep at the window, the
    tiredness and the sleepless night had robbed her strength. <br>
    The mother put her to bed, she hadn't slept either. <br>
    The husband didn't call, his flight never reached the airport 
    and no survivors have yet been found. <br>
    Tears were falling down her face, when she saw her daughter so desperate to see her father face ... 
    how would she break the news if the worst had happened? How were they going to survive? <br>
    The phone rang, and the voice on the other side, short and cold, spoke the words 
    that no one expects to hear: 
    - "Good morning, is it Mrs. Ines Silva, Mr. Carlos Silva's wife?" - Yes, it is. <br>
    - "There is no good way to say this but ... 
    we need you to go to the Institute of Forensic Medicine to proceed to the recognition of a body. 
    I know this is not the best time but I need you to provide me with some information. 
    Your husband was on the list of the passengers, but he never..." <br>
    She didn't listen the last words. She couldn't hear anything more, 
    tears blinded her and those words echoed in her head.<br>
    Little Luisa woke up to the sound of the phone, had her father called? But mother is crying ... <br>
    -"Mother? Mother? What's wrong? When father arrives? Who was on the phone?" <br>
    Ines grabbed her daughter in her arms, she couldn't speak, she couldn't think. <br>
    -"Mom! Mom! You're hurting me! Why are you crying? Mom! Mom! Stop mom! I can't breathe! 
    What's happening? Mom! Mom! M ..." <br>
    Overwhelmed by despair, Ines did not react to her daughter's words. <br>
    -"Daughter, it's your fault, if your father didn't come on that plane ... 
    if he didn't come for your birthday ... 
    sorry, but it's your fault, I lost your father because of you!" <br>
    Little Luisa didn't struggle anymore. She fell on the ground, her little heart stopped without 
    understanding what had happened ... <br>
    The gun was in the usual place, loaded, but now with one less bullet. <br>
    The sound was heard by the neighborhood but whoever was in the car didn't ear anything. <br>
    He rang the bell, wanted to surprise his daughter.
    He had bought the bicycle she wanted so much as an apologize for being late on her birthday, 
    he missed the flight, but she would forgive him. <br>
    After all, she was Daddy's  little girl.

    <p>
       
    Phrases that remained unfinished. <br>
    Stories that have yet to be told. <br>
    Unfinished words, lost feelings, stopped actions.<br>
    Was it worth something? No.<br>
    Will I change? Not either, but give up, never! (...)<br>

    <a name=Paths><h2><u><i>Paths</i></u></h2></a>
  
    <p>All paths lead to an uncertain space. <br>
    Seeing beyond what we deserve, doesn't make us go any further, <br>
    it only allows us to delude with something that doesn't exist. <br>
    So I walk on what I see. Because what I see I feel, and I know it is real. <br>
    Tomorrow I may not see the same path and feel the same feeling, but I know it existed.
    And that's enough for now.

<div class="background">
    <a name=Rationality><h2><u><i>Rationality</i></u></h2></a>
    
    <p>Everything has an explanation. <br> 
        Rationality is not a given, 
        it is something that is acquired through experience.
    </p>

<div class="background">
<a name=Reasons><h2><u><i>Reasons</i></u></h2></a>
    <p>
        There are no reasons. <br>
        There are no reasons and there never will be! <br> <br>
        
        There are no words that say no stronger than feeling, <br>
        There are no feelings that live longer than being, <br>
        There are no beings capable of loving without knowing how to live, <br>
        There is nothing if there is no whole, <br>
        and there will be no strength to continue if there is no reason to prevail.
        Prevail strong and unchanging, <br>
        Remain real and touchable, <br>
        but if there are no reasons, writing was in vain. <br>
        Everything was in vain ... <br>
        And I will go back in time, <br>
        and I will ask for forgiveness for not having grasped my reasons. <br>
        I will ask for forgiveness and forget. <br>
        Because living without a reason was in vain. (...)
