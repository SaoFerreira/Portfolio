    <h2 title="Touch"><u><i>Human</i></u></h2>
    <p>"Human beings are not the strongest species on the planet.<br>
         We're not the fastest, or maybe even the smartest. <br>
         The one advantage we have is our ability to cooperate, to help each other out. <br>
         We recognize ourselves in each other and were programmed for compassion, 
         for heroism, for love, and those things make us stronger, faster and smarter. <br>
         That's why we've survived. <br>
         It's why we want to."<br>
        . Jake Bohm, Touch.</p>
        <br> 

    <h2><u><i>Good things</i></u></h2>
    <p>"Please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough.<br>
         And i will always believe the same about you."<br>
        . Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower.</p>

    <h2><u><i>Laugh</i></u></h2>
    <p>
        "Perhaps the greatest magic of the human spirit is the ability to laugh, at ourselves, at each other, 
        and at our sometimes hopeless situation.<br>
         Laughter normalized our lives."<br>
        .Torey Hayden.
