    <p>"Human beings are not the strongest species on the planet.<br>
         We're not the fastest, or maybe even the smartest. <br>
         The one advantage we have is our ability to cooperate, to help each other out. <br>
         We recognize ourselves in each other and were programmed for compassion, 
         for heroism, for love, and those things make us stronger, faster and smarter. <br>
         That's why we've survived. <br>
         It's why we want to."<br>

        <p>"So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons.
            And maybe we'll never know most of them. <br>
            But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, 
            we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. 
            <br>
            And we can try to feel okay about them."

         Laughter normalized our lives."<br>
